CS561/CS594 (Advanced Linux Kernel Programming) is a graduate-level CS course at UIC, which serves as an introduction to coding in a real-world kernel environment.
I was unfortunately unable to take this class during my time as an undergrad, but the professor has kindly granted me all course material.
The following repo will contain all of my implementations of assignments from the course as they were given to me. I use the assignments as inspiration rather than a rigid set of rules, so my implementations will differ from assignment instructions
(i.e., any students taking this course and reading this should not use my code...)

Current modifications:
s2_encrypt system call which takes a user-specified string and encryption key, encrypts the string, and prints it out.
